# Token Handling Security Considerations

## Context

The Discord bot token is a sensitive credential that provides full access to the bot's capabilities. Currently, the token can be provided through environment variables or passed directly to MCP tools. This could potentially lead to security issues if not handled carefully.

## Issue Description

1. The Discord token is currently stored in memory for each client in the Discord Client Manager.
2. When logging errors, there's a risk of accidentally exposing parts of the token in logs.
3. There's no token validation before attempting to use it, which could lead to unclear error messages.

## Potential Impact

- Security breach if logs containing token fragments are exposed
- Unclear error messages when invalid tokens are provided
- No automatic token rotation or refresh mechanism

## Reproduction Steps

This is a design consideration rather than a reproducible bug.

## Possible Solutions

1. **Token Masking**: Ensure tokens are masked in all logs and error messages

   ```typescript
   // Instead of
   logger.error(`Failed to login with token: ${token}`);

   // Use
   logger.error(`Failed to login with token ending in: ...${token.slice(-5)}`);
   ```

2. **Token Validation**: Add basic validation before attempting to use tokens

   ```typescript
   function validateToken(token: string): boolean {
     // Basic validation - tokens are typically ~60 chars and follow a pattern
     return /^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{59,61}$/.test(token);
   }
   ```

3. **Secure Storage**: Consider more secure storage options for tokens

4. **Token Rotation**: Implement a mechanism for token rotation

## Considerations/Open Questions

- How to balance security with usability?
- Should token validation be more strict?
- Is there a need for a token refresh mechanism?
