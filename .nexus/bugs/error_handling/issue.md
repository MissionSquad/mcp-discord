# Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms

## Context

The MCP Discord server interacts with the Discord API, which can sometimes fail due to rate limits, network issues, or other temporary problems. The system currently uses a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for some operations, but this approach could be improved and expanded.

- [Link to system architecture](../../architecture/system_overview.md)

## Issue Description

1. Not all API calls use the retry mechanism consistently
2. There's no circuit breaker pattern to prevent overwhelming the Discord API during outages
3. Error messages could be more specific to help with debugging
4. Some error handling could lead to unhandled promise rejections

## Potential Impact

- Intermittent failures when interacting with Discord API
- Potential for cascading failures during Discord outages
- Difficulty diagnosing issues from log messages

## Reproduction Steps

This is a design consideration rather than a reproducible bug.

## Possible Solutions

1. **Consistent Retry Strategy**: Apply the retry mechanism consistently across all Discord API calls

   ```typescript
   // Create a wrapper for all Discord API calls
   async function callDiscordApi<T>(
     apiCall: () => Promise<T>,
     operation: string
   ): Promise<T> {
     return retryWithExponentialBackoff(
       apiCall,
       () => logger.warn(`Retrying Discord API operation: ${operation}`),
       config.maxRetries,
       config.retryBaseDelay
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implement a circuit breaker to prevent overwhelming the API

   ```typescript
   class CircuitBreaker {
     private failures = 0;
     private lastFailure = 0;
     private state: "CLOSED" | "OPEN" | "HALF_OPEN" = "CLOSED";

     constructor(private threshold: number, private timeout: number) {}

     async execute<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
       if (this.state === "OPEN") {
         // Check if timeout has elapsed
         if (Date.now() - this.lastFailure > this.timeout) {
           this.state = "HALF_OPEN";
         } else {
           throw new Error("Circuit breaker is open");
         }
       }

       try {
         const result = await fn();
         this.reset();
         return result;
       } catch (error) {
         this.recordFailure();
         throw error;
       }
     }

     private reset() {
       this.failures = 0;
       this.state = "CLOSED";
     }

     private recordFailure() {
       this.failures++;
       this.lastFailure = Date.now();

       if (this.failures >= this.threshold) {
         this.state = "OPEN";
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Improved Error Classification**: Categorize errors better for more specific handling

   ```typescript
   enum DiscordErrorType {
     RATE_LIMIT,
     PERMISSION,
     NOT_FOUND,
     NETWORK,
     UNKNOWN,
   }

   function classifyDiscordError(error: any): DiscordErrorType {
     // Implementation to classify errors
   }
   ```

## Considerations/Open Questions

- What is the right balance between retrying and failing fast?
- How to handle different types of errors differently?
- Should there be different retry strategies for different operations?
